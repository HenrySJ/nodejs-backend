# Welcome to the Node.js & Mongodb backend

## Features

- This project is the textbook definition of back-end and features the following:
- Enviornment variables, testing, middlewears, schema modeling, logging, error handling, authorization, authentication, and robust API with CRUD operations and auth protected routes.

## Setup

- Download Mongodb compass from [here!](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) It's a GUI tool for visualizing how you are working with your database.
- Use postman from the browser or Download Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for better performance. You can configure your request to perform your desired CRUD operation and visualize your changes using Mongodb compass!

## Inspiration

- This _portfolio/learning_ project is from the nodejs course by Mosh Hammedani at [codewithmosh.com](https://codewithmosh.com/). **_However_**, his course is 2 years old and due to packages updating as a function of time, there were many breaking changes that I faced. It was impossible to build this just by following along.

- As a self taught developer I had mastered the basics of Javascript and was studying the advanced concepts such as Classes, OOP, Prototypes, inheritance, and a introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms. In order for me to finish this Nodejs project, I had to develop a brand new skill which I still use to this day: **_Reading Documentation!_**

- I was fortunate there were so many depreicated and breaking changes in this project. It taught me that as a learning developer, more important than _the solution_ is knowing **how and where** to look for it. Moreover, I learned how searching for it will teach you how it relates to other parts of the project.

**_I'm proud of the soft and hard skills this project has taught me. Which is why I proudly share it!_**
